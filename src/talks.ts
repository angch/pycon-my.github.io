        "description": "### Problem Statement\r\n- Closed-source models like GPT, Claude, and Gemini demonstrate significant potential as LLMs, but enterprises and startups with sensitive data hesitate to rely on them due to data privacy and security concerns.\r\n- While numerous solutions and resources on the internet utilize closed-source models like GPT and Gemini to construct RAG pipelines, there is limited information available on building effective RAG pipelines using Open Source LLMs.\r\n- When it comes to using Open Source LLM, it is important to understand the prompt template to use to get response in specific format. While those with a basic grasp of Transformers can adjust parameters to enhance results, this approach may not be suitable for everyone.\r\n- Basic RAG solutions often struggle and tend to produce hallucinations.\r\n\r\n### Session Outline\r\n\r\nI propose conducting a fully hands-on workshop/session, where participants will construct an entire RAG pipeline using open-source: LLMs, vector databases, and embeddings. Additionally, I will demonstrate two advanced techniques aimed at improving results from LLMs. Below is the outline of my workshop talk:\r\n\r\n- Issues with Large Language Models\r\n- Understand the need of RAG and Open Source LLMs\r\n- Prompt Engineering Basics - Zero Shot and Few Shot\r\n- Open Source LLMs parameters tour: Understanding temperature, top_p and so on.\r\n- Building basic RAG pipeline using Open Source LLMs, embeddings, and vector stores.\r\n- Advanced Technique: 1- Using Cross Encoders Sentence transformers to Re-rank\r\n- Advanced Technique: 2- Fine Tune Embeddings for RAG and Hybrid Search\r\n- Build Streamlit app for your RAG application\r\n- Deploy it using secrets on share.streamlit.io",

Python's ability to handle complex scientific computations, automate workflows, and integrate with various technologies, makes it an essential tool for the oil and gas industry. \r\n\r\nSome of the Python's applications in the oil and gas industry are:\r\nData analysis and visualisation: perhaps the first use of Python has been to process, analyse, and visualise large datasets obtained from various sources such as seismic surveys, drilling operations, production data, etc using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.\r\nMachine learning and advanced analytics: machine learning models are important tools for understanding insights from data and making decision making in the oil and gas industry. Predicting equipment failures, energy optimization, scheduling maintenance proactively, forecasting operational KPIs, predicting reservoir properties, optimising portfolio, schedules, routes, and allocations, are examples of advanced analytics.\r\nAutomation and workflow optimization: Python's scripting and automation power used to automate repetitive tasks such as data entry, report generation, and process monitoring, which improves efficiency and reduces human error. Furthermore, it helps in integrating different systems and software used in the industry, creating seamless workflows and improving data accessibility. More and more platforms and systems have embedded Python interpreter for that purpose.\r\nProcess simulation and optimisation: Python (and Java) are used to build process simulation models that simulate the behaviour of systems and various processes under different scenarios. Examples are what-if analysis, scenario planning, optimize and improve process efficiencies in production operations.\r\nInternet of Things (IoT) and Real-time Monitoring:  Python is used to manage and process data from IoT sensors installed on rigs and pipelines for real-time monitoring. Python applications are also used to analyse streaming data in real-time to detect anomalies and optimize operations.",
